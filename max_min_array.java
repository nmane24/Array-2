/*
 * Code Explanation
 * Brute force : 
 * Approach 1 : take two variables min, max and point to 1st index and iterate and keep on updating the max min as we encounter. 
 * Time Complexity - O(n); for every element we are doing 2n comparisons ones for minimum & maximum
 * Space Complexity - 
 * 
 * 
 * Approach 2: do comparison in pairs , 
 * Time Complexity - Comparison will get reduced to 1.5n
